VST Plugins – Replication package

Overview of the replication package
This replication package is structured as follows:

    |--- Quantitative analysis/         The scripts utilized and the data extracted during the analysis.
    |--- Repositories data/   	    The scripts utilized and the data extracted during the mining process of VST Plugins repositories on GitHub.

    
Each of the folders listed above are described in details in the remaining of this readme.

Quantitative analysis

    |--- Figures                                       Contains the figures outputted from the "quantitative_analysis_script.py" Python script.
    |--- Output CSVs                                   Contains additional CSVs files outputted from the "quantitative_analysis_script.py" Python script, that were utilized at a later stage for this study.
    |--- Descriptive Statistics.csv                    The descriptive statistics of the mined repositories.
    |--- rq1.ipynb                                     The Jupyter Notebook in Python utilized for generating the plots and the descriptive statistics that are required for answering RQ1.
    |--- rq2.ipynb                                     The Jupyter Notebook in Python utilized for generating the plots and the descriptive statistics that are required for answering RQ2.
    |--- rq3.ipynb                                     The Jupyter Notebook in Python utilized for generating the plots and the descriptive statistics that are required for answering RQ3.

	|--- Cloned repositories                   Contains the SonarQube reports alongside the Python script responsible for cloning the repositories mentioned in the CSVs Used subfolder. 
        |--- CSVs Used                       Contains the final repositories dataset as a CSV file, which was utilized only for the sole purpose of gathering the repositories' names by the "mine_repo_data.py" Python script.
        |--- SonarQube reports               Contains the SonarQube compressed reports of all repositories. 
        |--- mine_repo_data.py               The Python script responsible for cloning the repositories
	|--- repo_final_mined_data               Contains the original repositories demographic data, after applying the inclusion and exclusion protocol.
        |--- contributors                    Contains the details about each contributor.
        |--- curated_csv                     Contains the final CSVs files utilized for the quantitative analysis.
        |--- issue                           Contains the issue's contents per repositories.
        |--- languages                       Contains all the programming languages utilized across repositories, not just the primary one.
        |--- raw_csv                         Contains the merged JSON files as CSV files. Those CSV files also contain out-of-scope fields but without duplicates.
        |--- raw_uncurated_csv               Contains the merged JSON files as CSV files. Those CSV files also contain out-of-scope fields but with duplicates + empty rows.
        |--- users                           Contains the details about each user.
        |--- *.json                          Contains the JSON files that are merged from the folder "repo_demographic_mined_data".
	|--- repo_demographic_mined_data         Contains the demographic repositories data utilized for the quantitative analysis, not merged, as JSON files.
        |--- more_data                       Contains data that was additionally mined.
             |--- commit_count               Contains the commit count as JSON files for each repository.
             |--- contributor_count          Contains the contributors count as JSON files for each repository.

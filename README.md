# VST Plugins â€“ Replication package

## Overview of the replication package
This replication package is structured as follows:

    |--- Quantitative analysis/         The scripts utilized and the data extracted during the analysis.
    |--- Repositories data/   	    The scripts utilized and the data extracted during the mining process of VST Plugins repositories on GitHub.

    
Each of the folders listed above are described in details in the remaining of this readme.

## Quantitative analysis

    |--- Figures                                       Contains the figures outputted from the "quantitative_analysis_script.py" Python script.
    |--- Output CSVs                                   Contains additional CSVs files outputted from the "quantitative_analysis_script.py" Python script, that were utilized at a later stage for this study.
    |--- Descriptive Statistics.csv                    The descriptive statistics of the mined repositories.
    |--- rq1.ipynb                                     The Jupyter Notebook in Python utilized for generating the plots and the descriptive statistics that are required for answering RQ1.
    |--- rq2.ipynb                                     The Jupyter Notebook in Python utilized for generating the plots and the descriptive statistics that are required for answering RQ2.
    |--- rq3.ipynb                                     The Jupyter Notebook in Python utilized for generating the plots and the descriptive statistics that are required for answering RQ3.

        |--- languages                       	Contains all the programming languages utilized across repositories, not just the primary one.
        |--- raw_csv                         	Contains the merged JSON files as CSV files. Those CSV files also contain out-of-scope fields but without duplicates.
        |--- raw_uncurated_csv               	Contains the merged JSON files as CSV files. Those CSV files also contain out-of-scope fields but with duplicates + empty rows.
